SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA <name>: <N> counterpart neutrino candidates from IceCube neutrino searches

IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube consistent with the sky 
localization of gravitational-wave candidate <name> in a time range of 1000 seconds 
centered on the alert event time (<tstart> UTC to <tstop> UTC) have been performed [1,2]. 
During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data. Two hypothesis tests 
were conducted. The first search is a maximum likelihood analysis which searches for a 
generic point-like neutrino source coincident with the given GW skymap.  The
second uses a Bayesian approach to quantify the joint GW + neutrino event significance, which
assumes a binary merger scenario and accounts for known astrophysical priors, such as GW source 
distance, in the significance estimate [3].

<N> track-like event(s) are found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the gravitational-wave 
candidate <name> calculated from the map circulated in the <noticeID> notice. This
represents an overall p-value of <p_gwava> from the generic transient search 
and an overall p-value of <pvalue_llama> for the Bayesian search.  These p-values 
measure the consistency of the observed track-like events with the known atmospheric backgrounds 
for this single map (not trials corrected for multiple GW events). The most probable multi-messenger 
source direction based on the neutrinos and GW skymap is RA <best_ra>, Dec <best_dec> degrees.

The reported p-values can differ due to the estimated distance of the GW candidate. 
The distance is used as a prior in the Bayesian binary merger search, while it is not 
taken into account in the generic transient point-like source search. The false alarm rate of these 
coincidences can be obtained by multiplying the p-values with their corresponding GW trigger rates. 
Further details are available at https://gcn.nasa.gov/missions/icecube.

Properties of the coincident events are shown below.

| dt(s) | RA(deg)  | Dec(deg) | Angular uncertainty(deg)| p-value(generic transient)| p-value(Bayesian)     |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|<dt>   | <ra>     |   <dec>  |      <angErr>           |         <pvalue>          |       <pvalue>        |
...

where:
dt = Time of track event minus time of GW trigger (sec)
Angular uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a circle 
     representing 90% CL containment by area.
p-value = the p-value for this specific track event from each search.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the 
geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be 
reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
