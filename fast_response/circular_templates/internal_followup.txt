Subject:  <alert_name>: Upper limits from a search for additional neutrino events in IceCube

The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

IceCube has performed a search [1] for additional track-like muon neutrino events 
arriving from the direction of <alert_name> (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/<gcn_number>.gcn3)
in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (<start_utc> UTC to 
<stop_utc> UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding the event 
that prompted the alert, <n_events> track-like <events_is_are> found within the 
90% containment region of <alert_name>.<coincident_events_and_p_str>
IceCube's sensitivity assuming an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) to neutrino
point sources within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region
of <alert_name> ranges from <low_sens> to <high_sens> GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second
time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination 
with an E^-2.5 spectrum are approximately between <low_en> GeV and <high_en> GeV. 

A subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert 
event time (<long_start_utc> UTC to <long_stop_utc> UTC). 
<long_p_and_lim> IceCube's sensitivity assuming an E^-2.5 spectrum 
(E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) to neutrino point sources within the locations spanned by the 90% 
spatial containment region of <alert_name> ranges from <long_low_sens> 
to <long_high_sens> GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window. 

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at 
the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can 
be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu.
