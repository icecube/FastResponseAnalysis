SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA <name>: Upper limits from IceCube neutrino searches

IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:

Searches for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube
consistent with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate <name>
 in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time
(<tstart> UTC to <tstop> UTC) have been performed [1,2]. 

During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data. 
No significant track-like events are found in spatial coincidence of
<name> calculated from the map circulated in the <noticeID> notice.

IceCube's sensitivity assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) to neutrino
point sources within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment
of <name> ranges from <lowSens> to <highSens> GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second
time window.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu
